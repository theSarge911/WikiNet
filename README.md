## Introduction ##
WikiNet is a very large scale Multi-Lingual Concept Network. It is developed by mining for concepts and relations and exploiting a variety of sources of knowledge from the Wikipedia. Concepts and their lexicalizations are extracted from Wikipedia pages. Relations are extracted from the category and page network, infoboxes and the body of the articles. The network consists of a central, language independent list of concepts, interconnected with a variety of relations to form a very large scale multi-lingual concept network.
